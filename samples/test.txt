My family

Good Morning! Today I will introduce my family to you. I am a father, my name is David Pearl, I am thirty-seven years old, I have been working as a writer and journalist since I was twenty.

My wife's name is Victoria Baker, and she is thirty-five years old, she is a wonderful theater actress. We have two children in our family âˆ’ Olivia, who is seventeen years old, and Lucas, who is fifteen years old. We also have a dog called Tremen who has been living with us for nine years and is part of our family. Our family lives in our beautiful house with a large garden.

My son is a DJ and he plays drums, and my daughter loves drawing and goes in for painting. They both go to high school and have good grades.
